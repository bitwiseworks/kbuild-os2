        o A real attempt at fixing the double quoting problem on windows. ash seems to want a
          space between a double quote enclosing the last argument on the commandline and the
          double quote enclosing the commandline (the -c argument).
        o Fixed a newline escape problem when using batch_mode_shell on windows with kmk_ash.

    - kBuild/footer.kmk:
        o Made up my mind about the command depency blocker variables;
          NO_LINK_CMDS_DEPS and NO_COMPILE_CMDS_DEPS.
    - src/gmake:
        o Added kmk_gmake which is (almost) vanilla GNU Make.

        o Make sure kmk_builtin commands don't get batch files and odd weird stuff.
        o Cleaning up the modifications. Changes are now either configurable
          or marked, and dead stuff has been removed (dll shell).

        o OS/2 wants -R.
