# This sets up a rule for creating the .pch file after qt5 and similar units
# are done modifying INCS, DEFS and company.  The '-PCH' variant of the VCC
# tool, is defined together with $(pchtool) and allow us to bypass the options
# and dependencies triggered by _1_VCC_PCH_FILE, _1_VCC_COMMON_OBJ_PDB and
# _PCH_HDR, and also make sure we  don't get circular dependencies by way of
# kDepObj and the debug info.
